# Time-Series Forecasting and Prediction

## Overview

This repository implements various time-series forecasting and prediction techniques using machine learning and deep learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization for effective time-series forecasting.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for time-series analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering techniques for better model performance
- Implementation of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
- Forecast visualization and performance metrics

## Models Implemented

- **Statistical Models**
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - Exponential Smoothing
- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- **Deep Learning Models**
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)
  - GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
  - Transformer-based models

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Time-Series-forcasting-and-Prediction.git
cd Time-Series-forcasting-and-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Ensure your dataset is properly formatted as a time series with timestamps. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.

### 2. Running the Models

Execute the main script to train and evaluate models:

```bash
python main.py --model arima
```

Replace `arima` with other model names such as `lstm`, `xgboost`, etc.

### 3. Visualizing Predictions

After running the models, results and visualizations will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Dataset
